calss parameters are not a fields in the class,
    to make it field use val or var keywords in the declaration:
        class Person(age: Int) to class Person(val age: Int).

Any auxilary constructor must call the main class or another auxilary.

object keyword in scala instantiate a singleton object.

COMPANION OBJECTS: in the same file write a definition for object and class for the same name.
    put the class level functionality under object definition and instance definition under class object.
        common pattern to write apply method as a Factory under object to make instantiation from the class.
