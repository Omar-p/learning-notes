calss parameters are not a fields in the class,
    to make it field use val or var keywords in the declaration:
        class Person(age: Int) to class Person(val age: Int).

Any auxilary constructor must call the main class or another auxilary.

object keyword in scala instantiate a singleton object.

COMPANION OBJECTS: in the same file write a definition for object and class for the same name.
    put the class level functionality under object definition and instance definition under class object.
        common pattern to write apply method as a Factory under object to make instantiation from the class. 

we can override fields in sub-classes directrly in the constructor class Dog(override val fly: Boolean, food: String) extend Animal(food)

to prevent the class to be extended outside the file it is in, write [sealed] before its definition.
