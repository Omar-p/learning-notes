program : file resides on the hard disk.
process : when the file loaded to the memory to be executed
   - stack - heap - text/code - data
   
Process vs Thread
  Thread: Stack + share from its process [Code, Data, Files, Heap]
    . cheaper to create and terminate
    . multiple threads in a process
      * share address space
      * easier to communicate
      * cheaper context switching comparing to processes.
  Process: Code, Data, Files, Heap, etc

Mapping of user threads to kernal threads:
  One To many --> work as kernel threads
  ManyToOne --> multiple threads in one process mapped to one kernel thread
  manyToMany --> rare
single-program-sys: new -> running -> finish states only. most of the time the cpu will be idle.
  multi-tasking : a multi-programming system where time sharing is used to allocate processor to 
   different processes. each process has a slice to make use of cpu then become waiting. and the next process take place.

  multiprogramming: allow multiple processes to exist in memory and running them in interleaved fashion interchangeable.    
process states in multi-programming system:
                          <--timeout/hPrio-
   [DISK][[New]]-->[RAM]Ready --dispatcher---->[CPU] [[Running]]---------->[[finished]][last statement/error(aborted)]
                    |-------[[waiting]]--------------|(i/o req)

   there are to other states [[suspend/block]] [[suspend/ready]]: 
     - the first in case all processes are waiting, so os move processes from waiting state to disk,
       to make some space in memory to begin executing other process instead of being idle.
     - [[suspend/ready]] when we don't have mem to run a higher priority process we move processes from
        ready state to disk.
     - each OS has dedicated place to store process data on disk to reload it when it needed,
       in linux there is something called swap space. win store process pages in .sys files on disk.
cpu interact with RAM, it's OS responsability to bring required data from disk to ram for cpu to operate on.

  1) pid 2) process state. 3) cpu registers.[PC] 
  4) accounts info(how much cpu time used)
  5) I/O info.  6)scheduling info.  7)memo info
