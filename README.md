## Why This Repository?  
When I started my learning journey, I needed a structured way to organize and revisit my notes. Initially, I used simple `.txt` files due to my limited experience with Markdown. Over time, I began refactoring older notes into `.md` files and enriched them with slides, images, and better formatting whenever I reviewed or expanded a topic.  

This repository serves as:  
- A knowledge base for my learning process.  
- A tool to revisit concepts and improve my understanding.  
- A way to share and potentially help others pursuing similar certifications or skills.  

## Structure of the Repository  
### `aws/`  
The centerpiece of this repository! This directory includes my detailed notes for:  
- **AWS Developer Associate Certification (DVA-C02)**  
- **AWS SysOps Administrator Associate Certification (SOA-C02)**  
- **AWS Solutions Architect Professional (SAP-C02)** *(currently in progress)*  

These notes cover services, best practices, and study tips that have helped me during my AWS certification preparation.  

### Upcoming Updates  
- **Docker and Kubernetes:**  
  I plan to dive into containerization and orchestration topics next, documenting my learning process as I prepare for the **Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)** certification.
