Schema:
  namespace to organize naming of the object.
  postgres create by default schema called public.
  [schema_name].[object_name]
  
  when u access a table without specifying a schema name, pg searches for that table 
  by using the [schema search path].
  
  $ SELECT current_schema;
  
  To view the current search path, you use the SHOW command in psql tool:
  $ SHOW search_path;
  
  change schema search path:
  $ SET search_path TO [schema_name];
  
  Users can only access objects in the schemas that they own.
  To allow users to access the objects in the schema that they do not own,
   you must grant the USAGE privilege of the schema to the users:
   $ GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA schema_name 
     TO role_name;
  
  To allow users to create objects in the schema that they do not own,
   you need to grant them the CREATE privilege of the schema to the users:
  
   $  GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA schema_name 
			TO user_name;
		
	$ [CREATE|ALTER|DROP] shema_name;

TABLESPACE: 
  A tablespace is a location on the disk where PostgreSQL stores 
  data files containing database objects e.g., indexes, and tables.

  pg uses a tablespace to map a logical name to a physical location on disk.
  
  PG comes with two default tablespaces:
    pg_default tablespace stores user data.
    pg_global tablespace stores global data.
  
  benefits:
    if a partition on which the cluster was initialized is out of
    space, you can create a new tablespace on a different partition
    and use it until you reconfigure the system.
    
     you can use statistics to optimize database performance. 
     For example, you can place the frequent access indexes or
     tables on devices that perform very fast e.g., solid-state
     devices, and put the tables containing archive data which is
     rarely used on slower devices.
  
  TO CREATE:
  $ CREATE TABLESPACE tablespace_name
    OWNER user_name
    LOCATION directory_path;  
  
  To create table, index, database in another tablespace other than 
  the default. specify it in the creation.
    $ CREATE DATABASE [table_name] 
      TABLESPACE ts_primary;
