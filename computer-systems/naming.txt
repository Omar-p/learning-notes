In DNS 
    -hostname can map to multiple Ip Addresses. 
        one reason for it is to balance the load
    -a single value (Ip Address) can be mapped to multiple hostname, 
        we can host multiple website on the same machine [It is called a Shared Web Hosting].
    - the value can change overtime.
    -no single table store all name to ip mapping, 
      instead these binding are distributed across many different name server => 
            introduce new problem: what server has a particular binding ? : solved by structured the names themself
                      each name correspond to a zone and a name servers associated with that zone keep track of the names in the zone.
