in many systems there are programs that run in user mode but help the
operating system or perform privileged functions.
pieces of what is traditionally considered to be the operating system (such as the file system) run in user space. 
In such systems, it is difficult to draw a clear boundary. Everything running in kernel mode is clearly part of the
operating system, but some programs running outside it are arguably also part of it,
or at least closely associated with it.

operating systems perform two essentially unrelated functions:
	providing application programmers (and application programs, naturally) a clean
	abstract set of resources instead of the messy hardware ones and managing these
	hardware resources.
	
a disk driver, deals with the hardware and provides an interface to read and write disk blocks, without getting into
the details.
	operating systems provide yet another layer of abstraction for using disks: files.
	Using this abstraction, programs can create, write, and read files, without having to
	deal with the messy details of how the hardware actually works.
	
	The job of the operating system is to create good abstractions and then implement
	and manage the abstract objects thus created.
