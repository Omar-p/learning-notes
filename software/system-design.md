## Gathering Requirements
- ask about the functionality
  - ex: youtube. {comment section, search ..}
  - ex: fb newsfeed {posts{iamge|videos}, comments}
- the scale of the system
  - ex: {location of the users, number of users, number of requests per second}
  - ex google drive {number of users, number of files, storage size}
- characteristics of the system
  - ex: {consistency, availability, latency, durability, scalability}

## Planning 
- after gathering the requirements, we need to plan the system

        - storage of user data
    - stage 2: core functionality
        - profile creation
        - follow/unfollow
    - stage 3: posting
    - stage 4: explore
    - stage 5: newsfeed
  - ex: ebay
    - stage 1: user side
        - search
        - filter
        - sort
        - add to cart
