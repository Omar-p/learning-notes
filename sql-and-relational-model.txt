CODD's Originial Relational model:
  - Structure:
      types("domains")
        conceptual pool of values from which actual columns and actual tables
        take their actual values.
      n-ary relations
      attributes, tuples
      keys: candidate, primary, foreign
  - INTEGRITY:
     entity integrity
       has to do with primary key
     referential integrity
       has to do with foreign key
  - Manipulation:
     relational algebra:
       intersection, union, -, x,
       restrect[filter tuples], project, join, divide
       - restrict & project are the only ops that take one relation as input !2.  
     relational assignment
