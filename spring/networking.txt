why is https is important ?
  - to handle man in the middle scenarios:
    - ISPs are notorious for injecting ads into HTTP sites. they might contain malware.
    - wifi hotspot can also inject add as well, and u don't know what the content of those ads are.
      - wifi pineapple, u boot it up. and it is ready to go and u can inject any sort of content into http sites without the user knowing.
    - malicious user can inject scripts that steal ur cpu cycles, to do bitcoin mining.
    - HTTP/2 being only over TLS for browsers, HTTPS is faster thant HTTP. [let's encrypt offer TLS for free]
