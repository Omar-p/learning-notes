Core:
  Aop:
    - based on simple predicate[all method in package, all method with specific return datatype..] we invoke some methods. Around | Before | After 
    - before ProceedingJoinPoint we can for example start transaction, check some condition, log the operation...
    - capture the return data of invocation.
    - After it we can close the transaction for example ...
    - u can do the same without AOP by extending the class. and adding the logic u want. but Aop do it in more convenient way.
    - useful when u want to execute methods on objects. [cross cutting concerns between objects]
  Servlet Filter:
    - implements javax.servlet.Filter
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Security:
		- out of the box:
		  - content negoatiation
		  - login / logout page
		  - user
		  - protection aganist common attacks [csrf , cors ...
		    - cache control
		      - Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
		        - add this header to respones from authenticated endpoint. we can disable it or add our owm. 
		    - Https
		      - to make spring redirect any request for HTTP to HTTPS .requiresChannel().requestMatchers(r -> [match requests in production for example. because development with http is easier])  hsts headers will included by default, u can disable or configure it.
		  - getPrinciple -> access to currently logged in user.
		  - ..
		- FilterChainProxy -> composing other filters into a single filter.
		  - entry point of all web based security.
		- spring scurity focus on application security
		  - Authentication | Authorization | protection aganist common attack.
		  - separation between authentication and authorization because of authentication is one time thing. authorization spread through the entire application.
		
		- antMatchers vs mvcMatchers:
		  - use antMatchers when u use spring security without spring [strut for example]
		  - when u use spring use mvcMatchers /foo -> willmatch -> /foo.json /foo.php ..
		    - keep order in ur mind most restrictive endpoints in the top.
		    .access('spEl')
		    .access("@beanName.predicateMethod(param1, param..)")
		    .mvcMatchers("/users/{name}").access("#name == principal?.username") <- the user only can access his data only.
		  - map (RequestMatcher, Collection<ConfigAttribute>) FilterInvocationSecurityMetadataSource --> SecurityMetadataSource[default impl -> ExpressionBasedFilterInvocationSecurityMetadataSource]. 
		    - AccessDecisionManager[route of all things access in spring security] 3 impl [default: AffirmativeBased (1 yes -> access), ConsensusBased (majority yes -> access), UnanimousBased (all say yes)]
		    - PasswordEncoderFactories.createDelegatingPasswordEncoder
		      - new DelegatingPasswordEncoder(id, encoders[id -> endcoder])
		      - when u want to migrate password to use another encoder , implement UserDetailsPasswordService and override updatePassword and sprind will call it automatically.
		    - WebExpressionVoter -> AccessDecisionVoter<FilterInvocation>
		    	FilterInvocation:
		    	  - curr req, curr response, context[all configAttributes]
	 		- all these work after [AbstractSecurityInterceptor 2 impls (1: FilterSecurityInterceptor, 2: MethodSecurityInterceptor)]
			FilterWriter
			
			
			- Oauth is a framework that allows people to grant limited access to protected resources on the web. 
			    the term access implies that oauth is about authorization, and this is true. however, open Id connect [OIDC], formalizes a way to authenticate with oauth as well.
	    - CommonOAuth2Provider -> contains info about well-known oauth2 providers.
	    - ClientRegistrationRepository[InMemoryClientRegistrationRepository] ->
	    - to initiate login flow OAuth2AuthorizationRequestRedirectFilter [if resolve the req then] redirect to OAuth endpoint itself.
	    - to get the authorization code and exchange it for a valid user -> [OAuth2LoginAuthenticationFilter] -> pass it to AuthenticationManager that delegat it to [OAuth2LoginAuthenticationProvider] that get a response using the access token response client. 
	    - from accessToken we need to get the user information for login using OAuth2UserService
	      --> in this case we're just accessing a URI with the access token that was provided. And then create a user from that.
	      - if u were using JWT, we could create it from id token itself.
  -------------------------------------------------------		
Data:
  Transaction:
    ts management ensure data consistency and integrity.
      - global ts: Multiple resources manage the transactions[managed by app server allowing for access to multiple resources(message queue, db..)]
      - local ts:  one resource manage the transaction[jdbc connection]
      
      -Programmatic: Developers writes custom code to manage transactions and set boundaries.
      -Declarative: separate transaction managemnt from business code.
      - LEVELS [DEFAULT(underlying DBMS), READ_UNCOMMITED, READ_COMMITED, REPEATABLE_READ, SERIALIZABLE]
  - when we add @Repository to any bean, spring automatically translate all JDBC exceptions to Spring Specific Exception    
------------
AOP
  joinpoint: where aspect will be applied.
  advice: what will be applied at particular joinpoint
  chain of advices: multiple aspect for a single joincut
  pointcut: predicate expression that match join point.
  
  -Target object: object that advised by one or more aspect. 
    spring aop will a create a runtime proxy for the target 
    object in order to add the aspects to the execution.
  -Introduction: declare additional methods or fields for a given class.
    spring aop allow that adviced object recieves new interface to implement.
     [adding additional behavior to a class at runtime] 
  -Proxy: created by aop to add aspect in the execution
   2 ways:
     standard mechanism:
       - JDK Dynamic proxy
     CGLIB
       - code generation library proxy.
  -weaving: the operation of program transformation that applies the aspect to  
    the target object in order to create the advised object.
    - Spring Aop prefer weaving at runtime
-----
Integration:
  endpoints pass messages[header+payload] via channels:
    - Adapters(connect ur channel to some other system)
    - Filter(remove some messages from channels based on header, content, etc.)
    - Transformer (convert a message content or structure)
    - Enricher (add content to the message header or payload)
    - Service activator (invoke service operation based on the arrival of a message)
    - Gateway (connect your channels without SI coupling)
 Message Channels
  . 2 General classifications of message channels
    - Pollable Channel
    - Subscribable Channel
    
  - Pollable Channel:
    . May buffer its messages
      . Require a queue to hold the message
      . the queue has a designated capacity
    . Waits for the consumer to get the messages
      . consumers actively poll to recieve msgs.
    . Typically a Point-to-Point Channel
      . Only one reciever of a message in the channel,
    . Usually used for sending information or "document" message between endpoints      
  - Subscribable Channel
     Allows multiple subscribers (or consumers) to register for its messages.
       Messages are delivered to all registered subscribers on message arrival
       It has to manage a list or registry of subscribers.
    Doesn’t buffer its messages
    Usually used for “event” messages
      Notifying the subscribers that something happened and to take appropriate action.   
  -----
  Adapters
    An endpoint that connects a channel to an external system.
      . it "provide the bridge between integration framework and the external
         systems and service"
      . Providing separation of the messaging concerns from the transports and 
        protocols used
    Adapter are inbound or outbound 
      . Those that bring messages into the SI channels.
      . Those that get msg from SI channels to the outside app, db, etc.
    Built-in Adapter
      File, JMS, JDBC & JPA, FTP, FEED RSS, MAIL ADAPTER,..
